    our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and
    to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes
    with your consent.

    <br><br>
    We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on

    <li>
      To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage

    </li>

    <br><br><br><br>
    <strong>3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong>

    <br><br>
    In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this
    section and/or with the following third parties.

    <br><br>
    We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
    <li>
      Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in
      connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company
      assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
      another company.
    </li>
    <li>
      Other Users. When you share personal information (for example, by posting
      comments, contributions, or other content to the Services) or otherwise
      interact with public areas of the Services, such personal information may
      be viewed by all users and may be publicly made available outside the
      Services in perpetuity. Similarly, other users will be able to view
      descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our Services,
      and view your profile.
    </li>

    <br><br><br><br>
    <strong>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>

    <br><br>
    In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
    purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.

    <br><br>
    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
    for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
    period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
    legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
    personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have
    an account with us.

    <br><br>
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
    information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
    this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
    been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
    information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
    possible.

    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <strong>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong>

    <br><br>
    In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
    organizational and technical security measures.

    <br><br>
    We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
    security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
    information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
    secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
    information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
    cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
    unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
    improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we
    will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
    personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You
    should only access the Services within a secure environment.

    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <strong>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong>

    <br><br>
    In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.

    <br><br>
    Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your
    personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending
    on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any
    time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using
    the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT
    THIS NOTICE?" below.

    <br><br>
    However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
    processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it
    affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
    lawful processing grounds other than consent.

    <br><br>
    Account Information

    <br><br>
    If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your
    account or terminate your account, you can:
    <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
    <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
    <br><br>
    Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete
    your account and information from our active databases. However, we may
    retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot
    problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or
    comply with applicable legal requirements.

    <br><br>
    If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email
    us at support@ligament.co.in.

    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <strong>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>

    <br><br>
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
    include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal
    your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
    activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
    standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
    such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
    mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
    online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
    this privacy notice.

    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <strong>8. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</strong>

    <br><br>
    In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant
    with relevant laws.

    <br><br>
    We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version
    will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will
    be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to
    this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a
    notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We
    encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how
    we are protecting your information.

    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <strong>9. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</strong>
